#New Personal Site

This is my SECOND attempt at building a really cool personal site.

This site uses Foundation and is mobile optimized (finally). I feel that it get's across more of a personal impression than my own website did. Here's hoping! 

 I really like the initial impression you get just by looking at that beautiful first image. 

I just started working on this so there's nothing too exciting goiing on here. 

I'll be improving it in a bit.
